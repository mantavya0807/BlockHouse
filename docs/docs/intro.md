Welcome to the **Crypto Price Tracker** documentation! This project is a simple web application built using **Next.js** that displays live cryptocurrency prices, and it includes developer documentation powered by **Docusaurus**.

### Why This Project?
The main goal is to provide a quick and easy way to track the latest prices of a few popular cryptocurrencies. At the same time, we demonstrate modern web development best practices, including:

- **Next.js** for building a responsive, server-rendered React application.
- **React Query**  for fetching and caching API data.
- **Docusaurus** for creating and hosting developer-friendly documentation.

By following this documentation, youâ€™ll learn how to set up the project, how the data is fetched, why certain technologies were chosen, and the challenges we faced along the way.
